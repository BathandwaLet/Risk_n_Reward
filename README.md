2) Randomised outcomes <br>
3) Modular game logic <br>
4) Console-based interface 

PLANNED FEATURES
1) Multiple mini games <br>
2) Player balance tracking <br>
3) Odds and payment tuning <br>
4) Frontend User Interface (Angular) <br>
5) Backend services (C#) 

TECH STACK <br>
1) Programming language: C# <br>
2) Framework: .NET 9.0 <br>
